## [Part 1.5] Building a self-driving RC car

This is a follow up on the project Building a self-driving RC car. A directory arduino_code contains an updated code for Arduino board, while a directory called raspberry_pi_code contains a code for Raspberry Pi, which is going to be used to collect training data. A full detailed post on this section of the project can be found on my blog https://jpboost.com/2018/03/11/part-1-5-building-a-self-driving-rc-car/.
