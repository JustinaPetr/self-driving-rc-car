## Self-Driving RC Ferrari

On my spare, time I read a lot about Machine Learning, AI, Robotics and its applications in our everyday life. While I have always found Machine Learning algorithms awesome, the process of how the code can make a physical device perform specific actions (think of autonomous cars, smart home systems etc.) have always looked like somewhat “next level” to me. I decided to change that perception and learn how to do it myself. I believe that it’s easier to learn difficult things when you make them fun and this is how I decided to make my own Self-Driving RC car!

The primary goal of this project was to not only deepen my knowledge in Computer Vision but to also learn how to set up the hardware and translate the code into actions. It has already been an amazing learning experience – I learnt how to solder wires, code Arduinos, understand circuit boards and I’m sure that there is a lot more to come! In this repository, I would like to share my experience of working on this project and I hope that it will inspire some other curious minds to create something fun and awesome as well! 😊

There are going to be three stages of this project:

__1.__ Hacking RC car with Arduino.

__2.__ Teaching a car to “see” the environment, avoid obstacles and follow the lines.

__3.__ Third stage is going to be a fun application of self-driving RC cars, but before I solve some challenges related to it, I will keep this part secret 😊

It is an ongoing project and I will constantly be updating this repository up till it all will be finished.  [Here](./Hacking_rc_car_with_Arduino/README.md) is a first stage of the project - a step-by-step process of how I hacked the RC car and a simple Arduino code to get this started.
